WSJT-X  is a  computer program  designed to  facilitate basic  amateur
radio communication using very weak signals. The first four letters in
the program name stand for  “Weak Signal communication by K1JT,” while
the  suffix “-X”  indicates that  WSJT-X started  as an  extended (and
experimental) branch of the program WSJT.

WSJT-X Version  1.6 offers five  protocols or “modes”: JT4,  JT9, JT65
WSPR, and Echo.  The first three are designed for making reliable QSOs
under  extreme  weak-signal  conditions.  They  use  nearly  identical
message  structure and  source encoding.   JT65 was  designed for  EME
(“moonbounce”) on the VHF/UHF bands and has also proven very effective
for worldwide QRP communication on the HF bands.  JT9 is optimized for
the LF, MF, and  lower HF bands.  It is 2 dB  more sensitive than JT65
while using less than 10% of the bandwidth.  JT4 offers a wide variety
of tone  spacings and has proved  very effective for EME  on microwave
bands up  to 24 GHz.   All three of  these modes use  one-minute timed
sequences of alternating transmission and  reception, so a minimal QSO
takes  four to  six  minutes  — two  or  three  transmissions by  each
station, one sending in odd UTC minutes  and the other even. On the HF
bands, world-wide QSOs are possible using  power levels of a few watts
and compromise antennas.   On VHF bands and higher,  QSOs are possible
(by EME  and other  propagation types)  at signal levels  10 to  15 dB
below those required for CW.

WSPR  (pronounced  “whisper”)  stands   for  Weak  Signal  Propagation
Reporter.   The  WSPR  protocol  was designed  for  probing  potential
propagation  paths   using  low-power  transmissions.   WSPR  messages
normally carry the transmitting  station’s callsign, grid locator, and
transmitter power in  dBm, and they can be  decoded at signal-to-noise
ratios as  low as  -28 dB  in a  2500 Hz  bandwidth.  WSPR  users with
internet access can automatically upload  their reception reports to a
central database  called {wsprnet}  that provides a  mapping facility,
archival storage, and many other features.

Echo mode allows you to detect and measure your own lunar echoes, even
if they are far below the audible threshold.

WSJT-X provides spectral displays for  passbands up to 5 kHz, flexible
rig control for nearly all modern  radios used by amateurs, and a wide
variety of  special aids  such as automatic  Doppler tracking  for EME
QSOs  and Echo  testing.  The  program runs  equally well  on Windows,
Macintosh, and Linux systems,  and installation packages are available
for all three platforms.

WSJT-X is an  open-source project released under the  GPL license (See
COPYING). If  you have  programming or  documentation skills  or would
like to  contribute to  the project  in other  ways, please  make your
interests known  to the  development team.  The  project’s source-code
repository can be  found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt, and
most  communication among  the  developers takes  place  on the  email

questions and answers, and general  communication among users is found
