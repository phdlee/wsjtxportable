This directory contains original artwork used to generate the graphics
used in various parts of the WSJT-X ecosystem. The CMake build scripts
do not  generate the  final image bitmaps  because of the  extra tools
required to  complete this  step. Instead there  is shell  script here
(make_graphics.sh) that does the generation. If you want to modify the
source graphics  or add new  ones then you  need an SVG editor  (I use
inkscape)  and  a   tool  to  do  various  conversion   steps  (I  use
ImageMagick), the shell script explicitly uses these tools.

The files here are:

installer_logo.svg - A 150x57 pixel  image (the size is important with
    a  whte background  that is  used  at the  top right  of the  NSIS
    Windows installer.

wsjt_globe_1024x1024.svg - A 1024x1024 pixel generic globe image which
    is used in various places, mainly for high resolution icons.

wsjtx_globe_1024x1024.svg -  A 1024x1024  pixel WSJT-X  specific image
    which is used in various places, mainly for high resolution icons.

wsjt_globe_128x128.svg - A  128x128 pixel image which is  used for low
    resolution icons.

make_graphics.sh  -  Run  this  script  (on  Linux)  to  generate  the
    intermediate  bitmap image  files used  in the  wsjtx  build. This
    script  generates all  but the  final  Mac iconset  file which  is
    generated by a build on Mac since it requires a Mac developer tool
    (iconutil). This script requires that inkscape and ImageMagick are
    installed.
