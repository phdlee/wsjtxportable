=== Help with Setup

The best source of help in setting up your station or configuring
_WSJT-X_ is the {wsjt_yahoo_group} at email address
wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com.  The chances are good that someone with
similar interests and equipment has already solved your problem and
will be happy to help.  To post messages here you will need to join
the group.

=== Bug Reports

One of your responsibilities as a _WSJT-X_ user is to help the
volunteer programmers to make the program better.  Bugs may be
reported to {wsjt_yahoo_group} (email address
wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com) or the WSJT Developers list
(wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).  Again, you will need to join the
group or subscribe to the list.  You can register for the list {wsjt-devel}.

To be useful, bug reports should include at least the following
information:

- Program version
- Operating system
- Concise description of the problem
- Exact sequence of steps required to reproduce the problem

=== Feature Requests

Suggestions from users often result in new program features.  Good
ideas are always welcome: if there's a feature you would like to see
in _WSJT-X_, spell it out in as much detail as seems useful and send
it to us at one of the email addresses given a few lines above.  Be
sure to explain why you think the feature is desirable, and what sort
of other users might find it so.
