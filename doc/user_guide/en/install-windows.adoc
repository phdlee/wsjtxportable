Download and execute the package file {win32}, following these
instructions:

- Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory, for example `C:\WSJTX` or
`C:\WSJT\WSJTX`, rather than the conventional location
`C:\Program Files\WSJTX`.

- All program files relating to _WSJT-X_ will be stored in the chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. 

- Logs and other writeable files will normally be found in the 
directory +
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\WSJT-X`.

TIP: Your computer may be configured so that this directory is
"`invisible`".  It's there, however, and accessible.  An alternative
(shortcut) directory name is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WSJT-X\`.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate. We recommend the program _Meinberg NTP_ (see {ntpsetup}
for downloading and installation instructions) or _Dimension 4_ from
{dimension4}.

- _WSJT-X_ expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
Windows, open the system's *Sound* control panel and select in turn the
*Recording* and *Playback* tabs. Click on *Properties*, then
*Advanced*, and select *16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)*.

- You can uninstall _WSJT-X_ by clicking its *Uninstall* link in the
Windows *Start* menu, or by using *Uninstall a Program* on the
Windows Control Panel.
