// Status=review

The _WSJT_ project was started in 2001.  Since 2005 it has been an
Open Source project, and it now includes programs _WSJT_, _MAP65_,
_WSPR_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_.  All code is licensed under the
GNU Public License (GPL).  Many users of these programs, too numerous
to mention here individually, have contributed suggestions and advice
that have greatly aided the development of _WSJT_ and its sister
programs.

For _WSJT-X_ in particular, we acknowledge contributions from *AC6SL,
AE4JY, DJ0OT, G3WDG, G4KLA, G4WJS, IV3NWV, IW3RAB, K3WYC, K9AN,
KA6MAL, KA9Q, KB1ZMX, KD6EKQ, KI7MT, KK1D, ND0B, PY2SDR, VE1SKY, VK3ACF,
VK4BDJ, VK7MO, W4TI, W4TV, and W9MDB*.  Each of these amateurs has helped to
bring the programâ€™s design, code, testing, and/or documentation to
its present state.

Most of the color palettes for the _WSJT-X_ waterfall were copied from
the excellent, well documented, open-source program _fldigi_, by *W1HKJ*
and friends.

We use development tools and libraries from many sources.  We
particularly wish to acknowledge importance of the GNU Compiler
Collection from the Free Software Foundation, the "clang" compiler
from LLVM at the University of Illinois, and the Qt Project from Digia
PLC.  Other important resources include the FFTW library by Matteo
Frigo and Steven G. Johnson; SLALIB, the Positional Astronomy Library
by P. T.  Wallace; and a high-precision planetary ephemeris and
associated software from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
