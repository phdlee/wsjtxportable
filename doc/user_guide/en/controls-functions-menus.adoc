Menus at top of the main window offer many options for configuration
and operation.  Most of the items are self-explanatory; a few
additional details are provided below.  Keyboard shortcuts for some
frequently used menu items are listed at the right edge of the menu.

==== _WSJT-X_ menu

This menu appears on the Macintosh only. *Settings* appears here,
labeled as *Preferences*, rather than on the *File* menu.  *About
WSJT-X* appears here rather than on the *Help* menu.

[[FILE_MENU]]
==== File menu

[[CONFIG_MENU]]
==== Configuration Menu

Many users prefer to create and use entries on the *Configurations*
menu for switching between modes.  Simply *Clone* the *Default* entry,
*Rename* it as desired, and then make all desired settings for that
configuration.  These settings will be restored whenever you select
that configuration.

As well as switching between configurations while running _WSJT-X_ you
can also start the application from the command line in any desired
configuration.  Use the command-line option
`--config <configuration-name>`, or `-c` for short, as in these
examples for configurations `FT8` and `Echo`:

 wsjtx --config FT8
 wsjtx -c Echo
