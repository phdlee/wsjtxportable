Select the *General* tab on the *Settings* window.  Under _Station
Details_ enter your callsign, grid locator (preferably the 6-character
locator) and IARU Region number.  Region 1 is Europe, Africa, the
Middle East, and Northern Asia; Region 2 the Americas; and Region 3
Southern Asia and the Pacific.  This information will be sufficient
for initial tests.

Meanings of remaining options on the *General* tab should be
self-explanatory after you have made some QSOs using _WSJT-X_.  You
may return to set these options to your preferences later.  

NOTE: If you are using a callsign with an add-on prefix or
suffix, or wish to work a station using such a call, be sure to read
the section <<COMP-CALL,Compound Callsigns>>.

NOTE: Enabling VHF/UHF/Microwave features necessarily disables the
wideband multi-decode capability of JT65.  In most circumstances you
should turn this feature off when operating at HF.
