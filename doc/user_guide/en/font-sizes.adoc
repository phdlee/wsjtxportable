- You can control the program's font sizes by using a text editor
(e.g., Windows Notepad or similar) to create a one-line file named
+fonts.txt+ in the _WSJT-X_ installation directory. Enter a single
line of text with four numbers separated by spaces.  The first two
numbers control the font size (in points) and weight (on a 0 â€“ 100
scale) of most labels on the user interface. The last two numbers
control size and weight of text in the *Band Activity* and *Rx
Frequency* windows.

- By default the four numbers are "`8 50 10 50`". If you need larger
fonts in the user interface and bold text in the decode windows, try
something like "`10 50 12 100`" (without the quotes).
