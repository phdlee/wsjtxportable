// These instructions are up-to-date for WSJT-X v1.8

*OS X 10.9* and later: Download the file {osx} to your desktop,
double-click on it and consult its `ReadMe` file for important
installation notes.  

If you have already installed a previous version, you can retain it by
changing its name in the *Applications* folder (say, from _WSJT-X_ to
_WSJT-X_1.7_).  You can then proceed to the installation phase.

Take note also of the following:

* Use the Mac's *Audio MIDI Setup* utility to configure your sound
card for 48000 Hz, two-channel, 16-bit format.

* Use *System Preferences* to select an external time source to keep
your system clock synchronized to UTC.

* To uninstall simply drag the _WSJT-X_ application from *Applications* 
to the *Trash Can*.
